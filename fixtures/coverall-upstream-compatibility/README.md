# An upstream compatibility test for uniffi components

This is identical to coverall fixture but uses upstream version of uniffi-rs
to test compatibility between upstream and this fork.

Upstream version of uniffi-rs is used to generate scaffolding for this fixture
and bindgen from this fork is used to generate bindings.
